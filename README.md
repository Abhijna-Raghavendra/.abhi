## "```.abhi```" - My attempt at building a version control system

This project has begun in a 36 hour hackathon. My sole objective of building this is to better understand version control. I'm not trying to make a VCS that will replace everything that already exists - in fact it will only try to implement the **most** basic features. I will be referring to [Eric Sink's blog](https://ericsink.com/scm/source_control.html) in this effort.

I will be attempting to implement the following:
- an ```abhi-init``` script to initialize a repository at a given directory
- an ```abhi-commit``` script to to commit changes
- an ```abhi-log``` script to display the commits in a well ordered manner

(If possible, I will also try to create a staging area...but seems pretty hard with the deadline)
